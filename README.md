All shopify sections / tweeks / help. I've learnt in a while

### Hi I'm Alex ([@taftera](https://twitter.com/taftera))

I've been learning about **Shopify** for a few years and I always find myself creating the same _sections_ adding the same _filters_ to multiple developments.
The information is so spread out that people get lost, well I did get lost (multiple times).

---

Before starting, all my Shopify developments are based in the **Dawn** template.

---

## Developments

1. Section refresh (with loop count + timer) - [code](https://github.com/taftera/shopify-help/blob/main/scripts/section-refresh/section-refresh.liquid)

## To Do

1. Add to cart button
